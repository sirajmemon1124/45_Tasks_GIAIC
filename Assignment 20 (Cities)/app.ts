// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains,
// rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list
// containing these items:

let cities: string[] = ["Karachi", "Lahore", "Islamabad", "Quetta"];

console.log("\n List of Locations:");

for (let a=0; a <cities.length; a++){
    console.log(cities[a]);
}
