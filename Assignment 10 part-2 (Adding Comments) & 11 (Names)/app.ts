//10. (Part-2) Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to
//each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just
//add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what
//the program does.
//&&
//11. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by
//accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
